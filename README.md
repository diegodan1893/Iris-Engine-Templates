# Iris Engine Templates

Trying to create config files and basic assets for Iris Engine
games completely from scratch can be hard, especially if itâ€™s
your first time doing so. These templates can help you getting
started by providing a base you can customize to your needs.

Each template targets a common game resolution and comes with:

* A config file with all the settings you need
* An example folder structure for your project
* A font you can use to render the text in your game
* Necessary images to display the text window and choices menu
* Some example transition images
* An example icon
* Some GUI sounds
